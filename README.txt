   .My personal AutoHotkey work

I've had about 3 year worth of AHK experience, and I'm still learning everyday. I've been told I'm quite good at it, but when I look at the pros on autohotkey.com, I feel like a noob.

Anyway, what you see in this repo was all made by me, if you feel like you need a tutorial, I'm always glad to help where I can. All items here go under the GNU v3 license, which is the standard provided with AHK.
